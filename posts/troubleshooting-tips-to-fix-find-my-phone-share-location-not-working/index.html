Check for Software Updates<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#a-check-for-software-updates>#</a></h3><p>Many smartphone users rely on their phone’s location-sharing feature for a variety of reasons. Unfortunately, it isn’t always reliable and users may find that the Find My Phone Share Location is not working. If you’re experiencing this issue, there are a few troubleshooting steps you can take to attempt to fix the problem.</p><p>First, make sure that the location on your phone is turned on. Without a working location function, the feature will not work. Go into your phone’s settings and turn on location services. If it is already enabled, you may need to restart your device.</p><p>Second, make sure that you have granted full access to the Find My Phone app. The app will not work properly if you have only granted it limited access. Go into your phone’s settings and make sure to grant full access to the app.</p><p>Third, check the battery level of anyone you’re trying to share your location with. If their device’s battery is low, the location sharing may not work. Make sure the person you’re sharing with has enough battery in order for the feature to work.</p><p>Lastly, you may need to update the app or your operating system. Outdated versions of the app or OS can cause the feature to malfunction. Check and see if you have any pending updates for the app or the OS and make sure that you’ve installed them.</p><h3 id=b-reset-network-settings>B.

This will help to reset any temporary issues you may be experiencing. After restarting your device, you should try disabling and re-enabling the Find My Phone feature to see if this helps to fix the issue.</p><p>If neither of the above solutions has worked, you should try resetting network settings on your device.
