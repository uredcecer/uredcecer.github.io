To help you capture screenshots on your Lenovo laptop, here are 3 tips for you to consider.</p><p>First, press the Print Screen (PrtSc) key on your keyboard. This will take a full image of whatever is currently displayed on the screen. The image will be stored in the clipboard and can be pasted to a document or image editor.</p><p>Second, another way to capture a screenshot is to press the Alt and Print Screen (PrtSc) keys at the same time. This will capture only the active window that is currently in focus. The image will be stored in the clipboard and can be pasted to a document or image editor.</p><p>Third, one of the easiest ways to take a screenshot is to press the Windows Logo key + Print Screen (PrtSc) keys simultaneously. This will create a screenshot of the full screen and save it as a PNG file in the Pictures folder.</p><p>With the knowledge of these 3 tips, you now have the tools to capture screenshots on your Lenovo laptop with Windows 7.</p><h3 id=1-preparing-for-the-screenshot>1. Preparing for the Screenshot<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-preparing-for-the-screenshot>#</a></h3><p>Taking screenshots is a great way to save important information or share parts of your Lenovo laptop&rsquo;s Windows 7 display. With a few quick keyboard commands, you can capture the perfect screenshot with ease. Here are some tips to take better screenshots on your Lenovo laptop.</p><p>Begin by pressing the “Prt Sc” or “PrtScn” key on your laptop&rsquo;s keyboard. This is usually located in the top row of keys and is labeled with a squiggly line and the letters Prt Sc or PrtScn. When you press the key, it will take a screenshot of your entire laptop screen.</p><p>If you only want to capture a certain part of the screen, you can press “Alt+Prt Sc” simultaneously. This will capture only the active window instead of the whole display. Alternatively, you can use the Snipping Tool, which you can find by searching for it in the Start Menu.</p><p>Once you have captured the screenshot, open your Documents folder and select the “Screenshots” folder. The screenshot will be automatically saved here in PNG format. You can open it and make any changes you need in the photo or image editor of your choice.</p><p>By using the shortcuts outlined above, you can quickly and easily capture screenshots of your Lenovo laptop&rsquo;s Windows 7 display whenever you need to.</p><h3 id=2-taking-the-screenshot-on-lenovo-laptop-with-windows-7>2.

Your computer can store a lot of information so taking screenshots can help you remember important information or even create a valuable portfolio of screenshots.

It&rsquo;s often easy to forget what you&rsquo;re trying to capture if you don&rsquo;t know what it looks like. You can use a browser zoom feature to zoom in and get a better look at the screen before taking the screenshot.</p><p>Second, find a screenshot capturing software or program that will suit your needs. There are many different screenshot capturing programs available online, so take some time to explore your options and find one that you like.</p><p>Third, use a file type that is easy for you to save and share with others. Common file types for screenshots include .png and .jpg. For the best quality screenshots choose a file type that can handle a lot of data, such as .tiff.</p><p>Finally, think about how you will store your screenshots. Keeping your screenshots in an organized folder will make it easier to find them later on. You can also store your screenshots in a cloud storage system to make them easy to access from any device.</p><p>With these tips, you will be able to take better screenshots on your Lenovo laptop with Windows 7.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZR4rlTNcdQE style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q: How do I capture a screenshot on my Lenovo laptop with Windows 7?
