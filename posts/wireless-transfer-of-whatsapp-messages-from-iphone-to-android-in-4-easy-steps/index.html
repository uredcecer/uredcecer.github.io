But don’t worry, we have solutions to make it easier for you. The first way to transfer your WhatsApp conversations from iPhone to Android is to use the Google Drive backup method. First, open WhatsApp on your iPhone and tap ‘Settings’. Next, tap ‘Chats’ and ‘Chat Backup’. This will prompt WhatsApp to make a backup of all conversations on Google Drive. Now, install WhatsApp on your Android device and log in with the same phone number. WhatsApp will then ask you if you want to restore chat history from Google Drive. Tap ‘Restore’. Lastly, agree to all the required terms and wait until your WhatsApp conversations are restored. This method is the fastest way to transfer your conversations from iPhone to Android device.\n• Tips for Efficiently Transferring Files Transferring WhatsApp from an iPhone to an Android device is not as tricky as it may seem. To transfer WhatsApp from an iPhone to an Android device, you’ll need an app called Move to Android. Here’s how to do it: First, install Move to Android on both your iPhone and Android devices. After launching the app, select “Transfer Data” on your iOS device. On your Android device, select “Receive”. Then, pair your devices by scanning the QR Code that appears on the Android device. Once the two devices are paired, select the chat data and photos you want to transfer. Finally, click “Transfer” and wait for the transfer to complete. Once the data transfer is completed, Move to Android will delete the data from the iPhone and store it on the Android device.
