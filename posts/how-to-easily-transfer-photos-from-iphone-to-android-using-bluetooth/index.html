Initiate the Photo Transfer from iPhone to Android Transferring photos from an iPhone to an Android device is a simple process with Bluetooth. All you need is an iPhone and an Android phone with Bluetooth turned on. Here’s how to transfer photos from an iPhone to an Android: First, open the Photos app on your iPhone and select the photos you want to transfer.
