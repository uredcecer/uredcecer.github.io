One of these services is Google Find My Device, which enables us to view the last location of a device.\nUsing Google Find My Device, you can view a device’s last known location, as long as it’s been used with a Google account. The map will show you where the device was last used and give you options to play a sound, lock the device or erase the data.

This page will show the approximate location of your device on a map. You can also choose to view the location history of your device which will show the last recorded location of your device.\nUnderstanding the last location of a device is useful if you ever end up losing it.
