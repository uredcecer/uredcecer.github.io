It&rsquo;s important to know which steps you should take once the update is complete. Here are some things to consider after successfully updating to the new Android version.</p><p>Firstly, check to see if the new version of Android has caused any of your apps to become incompatible. If so, you may need to uninstall them or find an alternative version. You can check which apps are compatible with version 9 on the Google Play store.</p><p>It’s also a good idea to back up your settings and data before performing the update. This will help to ensure that all of your information is safe. You can usually back up your data on cloud storage and then transfer it back to your device when you’ve finished the update.</p><p>After the update, the most important thing to do is check for security updates.

This means that certain tasks may take longer than usual. Make sure your device has enough storage and RAM to handle the new version.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uzu4Jp7UFpI style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: How do I upgrade my Android version 8 to 9?</p><p>A1: To upgrade from Android version 8 to 9, you will need to use a third-party app like “Software Updater”.
