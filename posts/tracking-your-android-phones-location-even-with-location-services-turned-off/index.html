You must have location services turned on for tracking to work. What if you need to track a phone without location services active? Thankfully, there are a few ways to track an Android phone location even if location services are turned off.
First, you can use a reliable third-party tracking service. A number of apps are available that can track your Android’s location even if location services are turned off. These apps use GPS, Wi-Fi and even cellular data, which are available on most phones, to determine the location of your device.

Third, you can also use Find My Device, a built-in feature of the Android operating system. Find My Device allows you to remotely locate and even control your Android device, including locking and wiping it if necessary.
Finally, you can use a SIM card tracker. This is an external device that is attached to your SIM card and will track and record your phone’s location even without the location services turned on.
In conclusion, tracking your Android phone’s location even when location services are disabled can be done, depending on the circumstances. Using a third-party service, emergency services, or Find My Device are some of the ways to track an Android device.</p><h3 id=i-tracking-android-location>I.
