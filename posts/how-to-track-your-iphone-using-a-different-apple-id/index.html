Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#5-conclusion>#</a></h3><p>With the advancement of technology, it has become easier than ever to locate a lost device. The iPhone, in particular, has a feature that allows users to locate their device even if they are not using the same Apple ID. This article will discuss the steps on how to find your iPhone using a different Apple ID.</p><p>First, log into iCloud.com with the new Apple ID. Once logged in, click &lsquo;Find iPhone&rsquo; and select &lsquo;All Devices&rsquo; to view the list of associated devices. Select the iPhone you wish to track and click &lsquo;Erase iPhone&rsquo; to activate tracking.</p><p>Next, you will need to open the Find My iPhone app on any device running iOS. Tap the ‘Me’ tab at the bottom of the screen, then select ‘Find My’. Tap the ‘My Devices’ tab and select the iPhone you wish to track. Finally, tap ‘Actions’ and select ‘Erase iPhone’.</p><p>Once you have erased the iPhone with the new Apple ID, the device’s location will be updated in real time. You should also receive notifications in the Find My iPhone app to alert you to its location. The device can also be tracked through the Find My iPhone web page.</p><p>These steps should help you find your iPhone using a different Apple ID.
